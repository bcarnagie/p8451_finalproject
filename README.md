This project investigates the relationship between insurance type and hospital length of stay among surgical patients using propensity score methods. By leveraging NHANES hospital inpatient discharge data, I employed multinomial logistic regression and random forest models to estimate propensity scores and adjust for confounding factors such as age, illness severity, and admission type. The findings aim to provide insights into healthcare disparities and the role of insurance coverage in hospital resource utilization.
