## Option 2: Explore a provided dataset for pre-specified research goals

I decided to go with option c, which involves constructing a propensity score to aid in an epidemiologic analysis of an etiologic question and then
performing an analysis using the propensity score to address that etiologic question.

My research question is as follows: How does length of hospital stay and subsequent patient disposition vary by type of insurance coverage in surgical patients?
